# What is a Proxy Server?

A **proxy server** is a server that **retrieves data out on the Internet**, such as a web page, **on behalf of a user**. So, for example, normally when a computer wants to view a web page out on the internet, you would just open up a web browser and then type in the address and retrieve that web page from its web server. When you go through a proxy server, the **proxy server will act like a middleman and will retrieve that web page for you**. When you want to go to a website, **the proxy server receives the request from your computer and the proxy server directly retrieves the web page on your behalf and then sends it to your computer**. 

So the question is why would you want to use a proxy server? 
Well, a proxy has several benefits:

Privacy  |
------------- |
It allows you to surf the internet anonymously because it hides your IP address. When you visit a website without using a proxy, your public IP address is visible so certain people can know which websites you're visiting. But when you use a proxy, your IP address becomes invisible because as the proxy server is retrieving the webpage for you, only the IP address of the proxy server can be seen viewing the webpage. So your IP address stops here and then the proxy IP does the rest of the work. |




Speed  |
------------- |
For example, if a company uses a proxy server and whenever a user wants to retrieve a webpage, the proxy server will retrieve the webpage from the internet on behalf of the user and then it'll store that web page into a centralized cache database. So if another user on a different computer goes to a webpage that has been stored in the proxy database, the proxy server doesn't have to go out on the internet to retrieve the web page. It can simply retrieve it from its database and then send it to the user. So this makes webpage retrieval much faster. |

Bandwidth  |
------------- |
It saves bandwidth, because a proxy server reduces the need to go out on the internet to retrieve data because it already has that data stored in its database. |

Activity Logging  |
------------- |
A lot of companies will use a proxy to keep track of what websites their employees are looking at. So when a company's employees are surfing the internet, the proxy will keep a record of what websites they're visiting and how long they were on those websites. And in addition, a company can also configure the proxy to block certain websites to keep their employees from visiting them. |

There's one notable thing that a proxy server **can't** do and that is **encrypt data** as you surf the internet. And when data is not encrypted, that data can be intercepted by hackers, ISPs, or governments with the proper equipment. So this is where a **VPN** comes in. A VPN or virtual private network not only hides your IP address, but it also encrypts the data that's being transferred between your computer and the internet. So any activity that you do on the internet, such as viewing web pages or transferring files, the data is encrypted and kept private when using a VPN. And no logging is involved. A VPN provides a dedicated secure tunnel between two points over the internet.
